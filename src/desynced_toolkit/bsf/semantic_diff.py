"""Semantic diff between two independently-compiled `.dcs` strings -- normalizes away
position-dependent wire encoding (omission-vs-explicit branch targets, and raw wire/array
order) so a diff shows only genuinely meaningful changes: added/removed nodes, changed
args/hidden fields, and branch targets that now resolve somewhere structurally different.

Built because the real in-game editor's own compiler recomputes both of those (which branches
get written as an omitted vs. explicit int, and the relative wire-array order of untouched
nodes) fresh on every save, for the *whole* graph -- confirmed the hard way reviewing a user's
real re-save, where two of five apparent "changes" turned out to be pure re-serialization
artifacts of edits made elsewhere, not anything the user touched (see project memory
`feedback_resave_reencodes_unrelated_wiring` / `reference_omission_vs_false_wire_semantics`).
A raw decompiled-text diff between two real saves is exactly as unreliable as treating omission
itself as "less real" than an explicit target -- both conflate a position-dependent encoding
choice with semantic content. This module removes wire position from the comparison entirely.

Approach: reduce each `BsfBehavior` to a canonical, wire-position-independent sequence of node
*content* signatures (op + args + hidden fields, deliberately excluding branch targets, since a
target's identity is only meaningful in terms of another node -- exactly the circular thing this
exists to resolve). The sequence order is a deterministic pre-order walk from Program Start,
following declared exec pins and resolved `jump`/`label` edges, so two structurally-identical
graphs produce the identical sequence regardless of what wire positions the compiler happened
to assign this time. `difflib.SequenceMatcher` aligns the two sequences (robust to local
insertions/deletions, unlike a positional/index comparison); only once that alignment exists do
we compare branch targets, by mapping each pin's resolved target through the established
node-to-node correspondence rather than comparing raw ids."""
