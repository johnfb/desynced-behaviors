    - explicit int wire position -> returned as-is (an int); the caller maps this to the
      destination node's NODE_ID once the full idx->id table is built.
    - explicit `False` -> "POP" (a real, meaningful authorial choice: pop the current context
      frame -- the innermost active loop iteration or call invocation -- and resume via
      whatever that frame's own continuation logic does; if no frame remains, the engine
      automatically pushes a fresh one and restarts from Program Start, not a separate case,
      just the unremarkable consequence of popping with nothing left. Never a bare "halt" --
      that's `exit`, a genuinely distinct, always-explicit instruction).
    - omitted entirely (val is None) -> `None` if the physically-next instruction exists.
      **This is not "no decision was made, defaulting arbitrarily" -- it's a real, explicit
      wire the real editor's compiler just didn't need to spell out as an int, because it's
      redundant with position** (user-confirmed, not assumed): the compiler only ever omits
      `next` when there genuinely is a connection to the node it placed immediately after this
      one; a pin left truly unconnected in the editor gets explicit `false` written
      unconditionally, regardless of what happens to physically follow. So this branch is
      never reached for a "nothing was wired, but something happens to follow anyway" case --
      that case doesn't exist in real data, because it would have `false` written, which the
      check above already caught. If the physically-next instruction does *not* exist (true
      end of the array), falls through to "POP" below -- falling off the true end is a real
      dead end too, handled identically to an explicit `False` by the real dispatcher.
      BSF renders no annotation for the omitted case (see behavior_source_format.md's "Control
      edges"), and -- a deliberate choice for BSF's own text editability, not a claim about
      what the original wire was -- treats it as following physical order on a reorder, the
      same way any sequential-code language would treat an unannotated fallthrough; it does
      not try to preserve "this specific wire went to this specific node" across a reorder.
      See behavior_source_format.md's "Node identity vs. wire position" for that trade-off.
