"""Runs a behavior given as a genuine Lua table (the shape `dcs_wire.decode_dcs()` hands back,
and `bsf.compile_behavior` produces directly) through the REAL game behavior machinery -- see
`behavior_runtime.lua` for the full inventory. In short: the real `GetFactionBehaviorAsm`
(data/library.lua) compiles it, the real `UploadBehavior`/`SetBehavior` install and start it on a
component, and a port of the real `c_behavior:on_update` dispatch loop executes it, so block
stacks (`InstBeginBlock`), `call`/return (`state.returns` + genuine by-reference parameters via
`state.stk`), `jump` label scans, memory interning, and every branch decision are the game's own
code. This class is only *activation scheduling*: deciding on which tick the component wakes,
exactly the part that is engine-native C++ in the real game.

An earlier version of this module simulated the block stack, `sequence`/`for_number` driving, and
per-instruction argument translation in Python (with `call` unsupported); that tier is gone --
git history only.

Parameters are component registers (the real model: `SetBehavior` sets `state.stk = #parameters`,
so the real `GetStack` routes addresses 1..N to `comp:GetRegister(n)`). `params=` writes them
before the first tick; `read_param` reads them back.

Timing model (all from the real dispatcher's own source, data/components.lua): a locked behavior
(the default) runs one instruction per activation and re-arms with `SetStateSleep(1)` -- which
pins the sleep semantics as "resume N ticks later": `wait(1)` is exactly the locked default, so
`wait(N)`/`SetStateSleep(N)` at tick T resumes at tick T+N. (An earlier `run_ticks` treated
sleep N as "skip N full ticks", i.e. resume at T+N+1 -- off by one, corrected when the real
dispatcher was adopted.)

One DELIBERATE deviation from real engine semantics (documented so nobody "fixes" tests into
infinite loops, or mistakes this for the game's behavior): a dead end that pops through the entire
block and call stacks ends the run (`BehaviorRuntime.Activate` returns "restart" instead of
executing the next pass). The real engine instead falls back to Program Start without yielding
and keeps going forever -- `exit` is the only genuine halt (behavior_format.md "Stopping a
behavior"; `reference_stop_deadend_semantics`). A test harness needs termination, so top-level
fall-off means "one full pass completed" here; note the real restart bookkeeping (clearing
non-keepvars locals) HAS already run when this fires, because it is the real `c_behavior_on_end`
that decided.
