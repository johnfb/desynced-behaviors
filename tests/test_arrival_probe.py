"""Golden differential for the arrival model (mock_world_spec.md's RequestStateMove-arrival item):
run the real ArrivalProbe behavior (`tests/data/arrival_probe.bsf`, compiled copy alongside) in
the mock world and diff its print stream against the behavior's real in-game run
(`arrival_probe_ingame.log`, captured 2026-07-20).

RESULT (this is no longer provisional): the in-game readouts CONFIRM world.lua's arrival model --
arrived iff `Map.GetDistance(unit, target) <= range`, floored at 1 for an entity target. The
coordinate-target cases (100/102/105) reproduce the in-game log tile-for-tile; the entity-target
cases (200/202/205) reproduce its arrival GATE exactly (distance readouts 1/2/5, the range-0 floor
to 1), diverging only in the stop *tile*, because the in-game Target was a 3x3 building (engine
closest-tile / placeable-location approach) while the mock uses a point target -- the pre-existing
pathfinding divergence flagged in world.lua's model note, not an arrival-model difference.

In-game geometry (from the log header): home tile {37,-10}; coordinate target 10 east = {47,-10};
entity target = a 3x3 Command Center (f_landingpod), raw origin {45,-15}, footprint x[45,47]
y[-15,-13], center {46,-14} (what get_location returns). get_distance on the entity measures to
the CLOSEST footprint tile -- {45,-13}, the SW corner (home is west & south of the pod; +X=East,
+Y=South) -- which is what yields the 1/2/5
readouts (measuring to the center {46,-14} would read 2 at the first stop; a 2x2 would too, so the
readouts confirm the 3x3). The mock is seeded to match with a point target at that closest tile
{45,-13}: for a point entity closest-tile == center, so it reproduces the entity-case gate."""
