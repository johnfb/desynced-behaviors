"""bsf/semantic_diff.py: a wire-position-independent diff between two real .dcs saves.

The real regression case: a user re-saved `magnifier_signal.dcs` in the in-game editor after
making three deliberate edits (added `unlock()`, retargeted a `set_number`'s `Result` straight
to `@signal` instead of through a scratch variable, removed an explicit loop-back `jump` in
favor of relying on POP's own auto-restart). The re-save *also* reshuffled two unrelated things
the user never touched: which branch of a `check_number` got written as an explicit target vs.
omitted, and the relative wire-array position of one `set_reg` node. A raw decompiled-text diff
shows all five as "changes"; a correct semantic diff must report only the three real ones."""

# 200-cap check reshuffled to omission (re-save artifact only), the NeedsRegen-marking node
# relocated in wire order (re-save artifact only), the signal broadcast collapsed from two
# instructions to one direct `Result=@signal` write, and the final loop-back `jump` replaced by
# relying on POP's auto-restart.
