"""Phase 3's golden differential fixture (mock_world_spec.md, user-designated): run the REAL
in-game movement-measurement behavior (`tests/data/movement_circuit_test.dcs` -- walks an
Engineer around the six HexAt R=1 ring corners, printing every location change with a
Simulation Tick stamp) inside the mock world, and diff its print stream against the behavior's
real in-game run (`movement_circuit_test_ingame.log`, captured 2026-07-18).

This exercises the whole stack at once: `call` into the embedded HexAt sub (real call machinery,
jump/label region dispatch inside the sub), sync + async `domove` with arrival re-issue, the
Euclidean sub-tile accumulation and 8-connected diagonal-first stepping, `simulation_tick`,
`sequence` cascade polling, and `wait` -- all through the real dispatcher.

Correspondence achieved (and its measured residue):

* The TILE SEQUENCE matches exactly, all 56 records -- same corners, same diagonal-first legs.
* Per-step tick deltas match within +/-1 (poll-phase aliasing around the same 2.5 ticks/tile,
  sqrt(2)*2.5 diagonal mean).
* Leg durations (corner-to-corner) match exactly for four of the five clean legs and within 1
  tick for the other -- the +/-1 is sub-tile-leftover phase at a corner handoff. Notably the
  real log's leg 3 takes 27 ticks where a from-zero walk needs ceil(27.68) = 28: proof the real
  engine CARRIES fractional progress across move orders, which the mock reproduces.
* The closed-circuit total differs by +3 of 157: a uniform +1 print-phase offset (the mock's
  behavior phase runs before its movement phase, so a poll sees a crossing on the next tick;
  invisible in deltas), plus ~2 ticks of head start the real Engineer carried INTO the log --
  its first two step intervals are 2,2 against the steady-state 2,3 alternation, i.e. it
  arrived at the start corner with residual sub-tile progress from before the log began. That
  pre-log state is unknowable, so the total is asserted within the decomposed bound, not
  equal."""
